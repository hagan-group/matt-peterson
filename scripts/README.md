installation
============

First, clone the parent repository and then change into the `scripts` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hagan-group/matt-peterson
cd matt-peterson/scripts
```

The scripts can then be installed with the accompanying `install.py` script:

```bash
./install.py
```

You can select which scripts as well as where to install them:

```bash
./install.py $script1 $script2 [...] --path $install_dir
```
